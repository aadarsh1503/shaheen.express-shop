        1. Types of Personal Data We Process
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        "Personal Data" means information that identifies or can be used to identify, contact, or locate a person or device associated with that information. Personal Data includes, but is not limited to, names, addresses, phone numbers. Additionally, to the extent that other information, including personal profiles and/or unique identifiers, is associated or combined with Personal Data, that data is also considered Personal Data.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The types of Personal Data we process are based on what we need to provide the Services, as a Data Processor.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        As permitted by applicable laws and in accordance with instructions from our clients, we may process different types of Personal Data, which we categorize as follows:
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>a. Identity Data including the name of the goods orderer, name of the sender, and recipient of goods.</p>

        2. If the client provides incomplete Personal Data
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If we need to process Personal Data based on legal requirements or the terms of an agreement we have with a Client, and the Client chooses not to provide such Personal Data or provides incomplete Personal Data, we may not be able to provide services or fulfill the agreement we have or are in the process of agreeing upon with the Client.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will process the Personal Data as it is (as is) provided to us. The Client is responsible for verifying and ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data provided to us.
      </p>

        3. How We Collect Your Personal Data
